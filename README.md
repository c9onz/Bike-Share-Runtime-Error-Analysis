# Bike-Share-Runtime-Error-Analysis
Google-based capstone utilizing Chicago bike-share data to analyze discrepencies incurred from a runtime error which resulted in additional riding hours for casual riders during the course of seven months.

The data is most often used to explore differences in bike ridership habits and to develop strategies that will attract and convert casual riders to members. While this analysis takes into account some considerations to guide conversion strategies, it does not follow the intended prompt of the capstone. Instead, it focuses on the runtime error from February 2023 through the end of August 2023, resulting in 72,888 additional ride hours. These discrepancies accounted for bikes not in use, which only affected non-members. Non-members are referenced as "casual riders".
